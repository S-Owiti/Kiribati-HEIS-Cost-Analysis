## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze the annual income and expenditure financial data of Kiribati residents. By leveraging the capabilities of Jupyter Notebook, we aim to provide meaningful insights into annual household income, annual household expenditure, and how to help Kiribati residents understand their spending patterns and manage their finances more effectively.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following data sources:
- **Average annual household income**: Contains income by income sources and by island group.
  - Columns: Wages & Salaries, Self Employment, Agric & Fish Sales, Home Produce Sales, Remittance & Gifts, Casual Jobs, Welfare Allowances, Pensions, Subsistence activity, Imputed Rent, and other income sources.
- **Average annual household expenditure**: Records each expenditure by expenditure group for Urban/Rural

  - Columns: 1. Food, 2. Housing, 3. Household Operations, 4. Clothing and Footwear, 5. Transport and Travel, 6. Tobacco & Alcohol, 7. Credit payments & Loans, 8. Educational Services, 9. Medical & Health services, 10. Goods given/received, 11. Misc. goods & services


## Key Metrics

Key metrics calculated and analyzed in this project include:
- **Net Income**: The sum of all amounts received.
  - `NetIncome = SUM(income)`

## Insights and Visualizations

The analysis yielded several insights, presented through various visualizations:

1. **Income Trends**:

2. **Expenditure Trends**:
   - A clustered column chart was used for comparison of income values and expenditure values

## Conclusion

This python project provides a comprehensive analysis of Kiribati residents financial data, highlighting key metrics and insights into income generation and expenditure behavior. The visualizations and metrics offer valuable information for Kiribati residents to make informed investment decisions, provide a clear picture of financial health and stability, and help identify areas where they can cut costs and save money.

By continuously updating the data and refining the analyses, Kiribati residents can facilitate informed investment decisions, ensure adequate preparation for emergency, and set and achieve long-term financial goals.
